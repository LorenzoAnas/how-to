   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/default/keyboard
   ```
   You might see entries like these:
   ```
   XKBMODEL="pc105"
   XKBLAYOUT="us"
   XKBVARIANT=""
   XKBOPTIONS=""
   ```
   Change the values as needed (for example, change `XKBLAYOUT="us"` to `XKBLAYOUT="gb"` for a British layout). Save the file, then apply changes with:
   ```bash
   sudo setupcon
   ```

These steps should change your keyboard input layout on Ubuntu Server.
